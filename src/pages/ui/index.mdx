Introduction
Nextra

Quick Start

Documentation theme
→
Blog theme
→
If you want to use Nextra without using these built-in themes, you can follow the Custom Theme docs.

Nextra FAQ
The Nextra FAQ is a collection of useful questions and answers about the project. If you have a question that isn't answered here, please open a discussion.

Can I use Nextra with Next.js app router?
No, Nextra only works with the /pages directory at the moment. Support for the app router has not been implemented yet. But you can use /app and /pages at the same time - just put your docs inside /pages and your other routes in /app

Can I use X with Nextra?
The answer is “yes” for most things. Since Nextra is just a Next.js plugin, almost all the things that can be done with React can be done with Nextra. Here are some examples and guides:

Use Tailwind CSS
Use custom CSS and Sass
Use custom fonts
How can I add a live coding component in Nextra?
There are libraries like Sandpack and react-live that can help you add live coding components to your MDX.
